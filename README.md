# Caesar Cipher

🔐 Caesar Cipher – Text Encryption & Decryption (Prodigy Internship)
This project is built as part of the Prodigy Infotech program to demonstrate a basic cryptographic technique—Caesar Cipher—using Python. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text by shifting letters using a custom key (shift value).


🧠 What is a Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. It's a great starting point to understand how encryption works.


✨ Features
Encrypt messages using a shift key
Decrypt messages back to their original form
Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
Ignores and preserves non-alphabetic characters (like spaces, numbers, punctuation)
Clean, user-friendly command-line interface


🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3
No external libraries required (fully built using Python standard library)


🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher-prodigy.git
cd caesar-cipher-prodigy

Run the script:

python caesar_cipher.py

Follow the prompts to enter:

The message

The shift value

Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt


💡 Example

Enter your message: Hello, World!

Enter shift value: 3

Encrypted message: Khoor, Zruog!


📚 Applications
Introduction to cryptography
Learning string manipulation in Python
Demonstrating basic cybersecurity concepts


📌 Project Status
