🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption Tool
This project implements the classic Caesar Cipher encryption technique in Python. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting characters based on a given key, preserving the simplicity and essence of one of the oldest known encryption methods.


🧠 What is a Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. It's a simple yet foundational cryptographic method often used to introduce encryption concepts.


🚀 Features
Encrypt any text using a custom shift key
Decrypt ciphered text back into readable form
Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
Ignores and preserves non-alphabetic characters (e.g., punctuation, numbers, etc.)
Easy to modify and integrate into other Python-based projects


🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Standard Library only)


📁 How to Use
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Psalunkhe07/caesar-cipher.git

# Run the script
python caesar_cipher.py


🎯 Example
Plain Text:  Hello, World!
Shift Key:   3
Encrypted:   Khoor, Zruog!
